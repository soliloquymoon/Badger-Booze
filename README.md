# Badger Booze

## Introduction
***Badger Booze*** is a point-and-click tycoon game simulating a busy bar in Madison. Players assume the role of a bartender, tasked with creating drinks by experimenting with various combinations based on random customer orders.

Customers can provide detailed recipes or just a vague descriptions, challenging the player’s knowledge and creativity. The game scores players based on the quality of drinks and customer satisfaction, according to the attributes of the ingredients mixed, which in turn affects the player’s in-game earnings.

Our game offers an immersive experience with a unique Wisconsin theme, combining the thrill of a fast-paced environment with a learning opportunity about bartending.

## Design: Key Features
- **User Interface (UI)**: The user-guidance UI elements are user-friendly aspects, including the recipe book and the tutorial messages. The images of badgers, drinks and ingredients that look like the actual items, and the title scene background with the capitol building are visually appealing aspects.
- **Order Management System**: Manages the incoming customer orders, validates the drinks created by the player, and tracks customer satisfaction based on correct or incorrect orders which determines the amount of revenue you earned for a given order completed.
- **Ingredient Usage System**: Manages the amount of ingredients used by the player on a given day and calculates how much money is cut from the revenue based on the ingredient usage (unnecessary excessive usage of ingredients to make a certain drink will lead to more money being spent to make the drink than it’s supposed to thus players have to manage their resources and make drinks optimally)
- **Scoring and Feedback**: Tracks player performance and revenue gained based on how well orders are fulfilled, with immediate feedback to the player (e.g., customer reactions, updates in revenue), and final result which includes total revenue calculation at the end of an in-game day.
- **Mobile-specific Mechanism**: Unlike most bartender games in the mobile market that are just solely point-and-click in terms of interactivity, Badger Booze takes advantage of mobile-specific hardware. Players physically tilt and shake their phones using the accelerometer and gyroscope to simulate pouring and mixing drinks, adding a more immersive and engaging element to the gameplay.
